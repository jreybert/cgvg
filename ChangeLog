1.6.2 - Minor cleanup

	Been a while... haven't really had any need to add or update cgvg.
	We now have a cscope at http://cscope.sourceforge.net/ which I urge
	people to look at.  Even then, I still find myself using cgvg a lot.

	I'd like to thank Joachim Bauernberger and Timothy Cava for pointing
	out the bugs fixed in this release.  Thanks to Sergio Talens-Oliag
	for packaging it for Debian.  And thanks to everyone who has written
	a kind email showing your appreciation. :)

	Fixed in this release:
	* The pager wouldn't allow for selection of item "0".
	* If $HOSTNAME wasn't set, it was left blank, causing the log cleanup
	  to fail.
	* Misplaced negation in log cleanup would always delete files.
	* More exact matching on checking that an editor is in the $PATH.

1.6.1 - Pretty much added two things... 

	* "Colon mode"... which prints out something like this:

		41 cgvg-common.pl:94  open (IN, "<$RCFILE");

	  instead of this:

		41 cgvg-common.pl  94 open (IN, "<$RCFILE");
	
	  written on the request of a coworker who wanted it to mesh with
	  his editor a bit better.

	* Thanks to the good grace of Jeffrey R. Hay, cgvg now how has
	  built-in pager so that colors will remain while paging and
	  editing can occur while viewing the output.  Check it out. :)

1.6.0 - Some decent change to this version.
	
	* Cleaned up the code some.  I've introduced a cgvg-common.pl
	  file.  This does (and will) contain common subroutines and
	  variables.  More stuff will move there as I possibly do a GUI.
	  (If I do one.)  The script are now also broken into subroutines
	  a bit for easier readability and managability.  Some more cleaning
	  has to happen, but this is a start.

	* Logfile storage has changed quite a bit.  Now instead of one
	  global .cglast file, I have a .cgvg/ directory where I store
	  a log file for each shell in the form $HOSTNAME.shell_pid.
	  This is so that a user can use cgvg in several different places
	  and not lose their searches.  The name is for cleanup.  If it
	  doesn't find a pid that there's a log for on the present machine,
	  it deletes the log file.  The last search is still obtainable, but
	  now with a '-l' option... so "cg -l" to see the last search, and
	  "vg -l number" to edit an entry from that log.  Also note that
	  not having a log with the present terminal will default it to
	  the last log.  (Some of this idea and the next two came from Goran
	  Koruga <goran.koruga@hermes.si>)
	
	* There is no more BOLD option.  Now, all colors are achieveable
	  as the color, and b_color for the bold version (so "red" and
	  "b_red" for example).
	
	* The EXCLUDE option is now in the logfile, as is an AGE option
	  for a default cleanup time on logfiles.

	* There is now a configure script for this program to make things
	  (hopefully) more convenient.  (Fix by Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>)
	
	* Fix for handling the $EDITOR variable better if the editor is
	  using any arugments.  (Fix by Clinton Popetz <cpopetz@cpopetz.com>)

	* Also searching for *.l, *.y and *.C files by default as well.
	  (Request by Adam Marks <adam@cp.net>)

1.5.2 - Just a small bugfix release.  First, I removed a debug statement
	that I forgot to take out before sending off the last version
	(oops).  The bigger change is that now it'll parse through
	directories that are given as arguments... so if you do a
	"cg 'pattern' dir1 dir2", it'll recursively search through
	those directories.

August 25, 1999
1.5.1 - Fixed a bug where if one and only one file was specified
	to search through and it was an existing text file that it
	would read that file rather than blindly assume it's a
	search expression and do a huge recursive search.

	Cleaned up the finding code a bit.  Now both the default
	search and a user-specified search use the same &wanted
	subroutine, with the search list being specified by a
	$SEARCH variable.  Along with this, the default search list
	is user-defineable in the .cgvgrc file as well.

August 18, 1999
1.5 -	The big change of this version is that now the searching is
	handled by Perl rather than by grep(1), egrep(1) and fgrep(1).
	This required quite a bit of change, but everything is working
	like it was before.  The only really desirable option beyond
	the '-n' option (which I've covered) was '-i', which is
	covered as the only option at the moment.  The only things
	that are not handled by Perl now and are hard-coded now are
	"stty" and "which", and when I find a clean way of implementing
	them without requiring a trip to CPAN, I'll add those as well.

	Bugs have been fixed with handling the configuration file,
	and with the user-specified search list.  Now a user can
	search (for example) all C files with "cg pattern *.c" or
	"cg pattern '*.c'"... with the former being expanded by the
	shell and the latter being pattern matched by Perl.  Also
	note that the latter is a recursive search whereas the former
	is only those files specified on the command-line.  Colors
	are also now configurable by the configuration file.

	Manpages and a Makefile have also been added for user convenience.

August 15, 1999
1.4 -	Updates made here fix a bug that not all of the search list
	was being utilized, and the biggest change being that cg
	now uses Perl's internal File::Find routine instead of an
	external /bin/find (or whatever) to get the list of files.

	Syntax has changed a bit because of this... when files to
	search are specified, it must be done in quotes (single or
	double) like "cg pattern '*'" to search all files.

	Also, there's now a ~/.cgvgrc file where users can specify
	their editor, and bold and coloring options so that not all
	system users have to use the default.  See the "cgvgrc_example"
	file for a sample with the defaults.  Currently only $EDITOR,
	$BOLD, $BOLD_ALTERNATE and $COLORS can be set.  A bug in
	version 1.3 was corrected with the $BOLD option as well.

July 7, 1999
1.3 -	Same as the last version, except now colors are supported
	in cg.  There are the options $BOLD, $BOLD_ALTERNATE and  
	$COLOR to be set to 1 (on) or 0 (off) if you do or don't 
	want these feature.  $COLOR is needed for the $BOLD
	options, and really you should select only one or neither
	of the two $BOLD options.  Colors only work when displaying
	straight to STDOUT.

	In vg, I've gotten rid of the $CGEDITOR variable and replaced
	it with the standard $EDITOR environment variable since I've
	found most editors to support the +number option.  Also fixed
	a bug to give a clear error when the editor doesn't exist.

June 30, 1999
1.2 -	More changes to the cg script.  Rather than simply print the
	logfile like previous versions, I actually attempt to make
	it human readable now.  The logfile keeps the same format,
	just what's printed to the screen has changed.  In doing this,
	though, there are a gotcha or two to watch for in how much
	of the string can be printed.  Also, I've made an attempt to
	have the program auto-detect the number of columns using
	"stty -a" rather than assuming 80 columns.  Switched to
	using "fgrep" instead of regular "grep", as it seemed more
	appropriate for this task.  Did some code cleanup in both
	cg and vg otherwise.  An environment variable, $CGEDITOR
	can be set for choosing an editor to use now.

	With this version, I'm close to probably as far as this
	may go (with the exceptions of patches and improvements).
	Future versions of this program will possibly just focus
	on cleanups from the current state.  Realistically, the
	next step is to make a real cscope clone.  It's often in
	the back of my mind, so feel free to contact me if you
	would like to discuss this possibility.

June 28, 1999
1.1 - 	Changed how the cg program works a bit.  Instead of having the
	user define the files to search in (*, *.c, *.java, etc.), it
	now has a list of files built-in.  This should decrease the
	overhead quite a bit (in not searching all files), allow for
	all versions of grep (instead of just GNU grep v2.3 and later),
	and cut an argument... none of the flexibility is lost, and
	it's actually advisable to avoid the mode where you specify
	the files to search for as a huge overhead reduction in the
	program's runtime.  The use of arguments for find(1) chosen 
	are also done so that non-GNU versions of it can be used, and 
	I use Perl to do some cleanup.

	The vg script has also been modified to support both "vim"
	and regular "vi".  Before, I was executing "vim path/file +line",
	and instead now am running "vi +line path/file", which is
	how both traditional vi's and vim can handle it.  All in all,
	these scripts will work fine on both the Linux and Solaris
	machines I have tested on (both GNU and non-GNU tools).

	Renamed "rg" to "cg", as the name seemed more appropriate.

June 8, 1999
1.0 -	Initial release.  Requires GNU grep v2.3 or later, and is a
	bit of a dog to run... but hey, it does what it's supposed to
	do, so I'm happy for now.  Scripts are "rg" and "vg".
