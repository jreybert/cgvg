# vg - Vi Grepped - edit a file at a line specified in a cg search.
# Copyright 2000-2002 by Joshua Uziel <uzi@uzix.org> - version @VERSION@
#
# Usage: vg number
#
# Helper script to go with cg for opening a editor conveniently
# with the correct file and line as shown in cg's log.  Run this
# with a single numerical argument (ie. "vg 3") to edit the desired
# log entry.
#
# This script seems to work fine with a number of editors, including
# vi, vim, emacs, pico, joe, etc.  (Despite it's name.)
